            <p>Tired&nbsp; of government pissing away taxpayer money and wasting our hard earned tax dollars on BS projects. We the people need to decide how government spends our money. We propose implementing direct democracy and giving the people the power to prioritise and decide&nbsp; how and on what the national and local governments spend funds on by holding a yearly referendum at the national and local level to decide the next year's&nbsp; projrcts and budget. We call for full and open diclosure of all local and national government budgets and future spending plans. <p/>
            <br/>
            The government needs to stop treating citizens like idiots as it is the government Technocrats and&nbsp;&nbsp;bureaucracy who are nothing but a bunch of well-educated idiots&nbsp; and it is the citizens, the masses, who know what is best for us not over-qualified idiots hungry for power and control of the general public.</p>

            <p>Again the government Techocrats,&nbsp;bureaucracy and other well-educated idiots hungry for power and control think they know best and should be telling&nbsp; us the general public how to lead our lives&nbsp; by implementing rules around evry corner, both at the national and local government level.</p>
            <p>We need to cut out a lot of these BS OSH rules and stop telling the public what they can and cannot do around every corner. FFS government just stop and rescind / recall all these ridiculous&nbsp; rules. If I want to paint my house roof, I sure don't nee to put scaffolding and a safety net around the bloody house for "safety" because the idiot legislators think I can't keep myself safe. This is just one example of government overreach, there are many more. All these ridiculous rules add to the cost of everything and accomplish nothing but stroking idiot lawmaker's egos.</p>
            <p>New Zealand is fast becoming a "Nanny State". This madness needs to stop !&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Rules and regulations are getting out of control. Yes, there is a need for basic safety rules to prevent workplace accidents but the shit these guys are doing is way out of control and&nbsp;  needs reeling in. We need to immediately cut out the BS and trust that people will take the right precautions to keep themselves safe and fire all the clowns that made these BS rules, fire their arses and never allow them to meddle in regulating again.</p>

            <p>Woke nonsense has gotten out of hand and it's time to fight back for a return to normalcy and common sense. This BS has been pushed on society for long enough. The liberal retards are free to do whatever they want in life as long as they don't harm others. Imagining racism, sexism or whatever dellusion comes&nbsp; into their pea-sized brains and the rest of us being forced to hear it must end now.</p>
            <p>We need to take the following steps to return to normalcy and focus on things that really matter rather than accommadating for a tiny noisy monority forever pleading "oppression" which is nothing more than a figment of their dellusion minds. We need to return to normalcy and the sooner the better.</p>
            <p>Return to common sense:</p>
            <p>1)&nbsp; Disolve all government "DEI", "LGBT...." and :"Equity" boards / initiatives and remove funding.</p>
            <p>2)&nbsp; &nbsp;Remove all pornographic books from the children's sections of public libraries. What sick bastards thought this kind of thing is acceptable? We must stop poisining and confusing our children's minds.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;3) Ban "Drag queen story time" and other such perverse events that involve sexuality, from being carried out with children under the age of 18. Sex education in high school is enough. Keep the gays and queers away from our children is the bottom line.</p>
            <p>4) Only the New Zealand and Maori flags are to be displayed in public buildings such as schools, city councils and public libraries and in public spaces. No taxpayer funded buildings or spaces to be allowed to fly any other flags. Noncompliance will result in immediate firing and prosecution of whoever breaks this rule.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;5) No taxpayer funding for gay and transsexual organizations and medical procedures. They are free to exist but just not at the taxpayer's expense.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;6) There will be no special privileges for any minority, ethnic group or sexual orientation group. We will run a colour blind society based on skill, experience and merit only. There will be no quotas for hiring and deciding roles other than the most qualified candidates being nominated into any public and private. roles and positions with a few exceptions noted in proposal 8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>This treaty nonsense needs to be resolved once and for all, in perpetuity without possibility of any future claims.</p>
            <p>Settle the treaty of Waitangi based on the following conditions:</p>
            <p>1) Select a list of 5 options to settle the treaty claims. Hold a national referendum and let all the people of New Zealand decide how to settle this dispute in perpetuity. Once the referendum has been held, this issue will be off the table forever and will be considered resolved.</p>
            <p>2) All Iwi will be mandated to return 50% of profits at a minimum each year back into grass roots organisations such as marae and other social initiatives geared towards improving life for ordinary Maori.</p>
            <p>3) All Iwi must operate with complete financial transparency to the public. All financial records for all Iwi to be located on one central website.</p>
            <p>4) All Iwi are to undertake a full external audit every year with the results of these audits to be published in the relevant section, easily visible on the central Iwi website. Iwi like any organisation need to prove that they are acting responsibly and in the best interests of their stakeholders,  the Maori society, with repercussions for irresponsibility.</p>
            <p>5) Impose salary caps on Iwi management and executives in line with the salary caps of NPOs and NGOs, We don't want a bunch of fat cats at the top making themselves rich at ttheir stakeholders' expense. Iwi funds are for improving the oportunities at a better life for Maori society on the whole.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In 2023 the New Zealand government gave $1.4 billion NZD and approx $1 billion in 2024. Why the hell are we sending our hard earned tax money to other parts of the world for them to mismanage?? Sure, we can send our teams of experts and support to help out in disasters but that's all. Sure, we can help out our South Pacific neighbours, conditional on them not allowing China in.They can't have it both ways, if they accept money from China we will cut all ties and stop all immigration from offending countries immediately.</p>
            <p>2023</p>
            <p>1) Pacific Island Countries: Approximately $600 million NZD</p>
            <p>Cut all funding to Fiji if they don't kick out the Chinese and ban them from entering NZ.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;2) South East Asia: Around $200 million NZD</p>
            <p>WTF why are we giving money to&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia and the Philippines?</p>
            <p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Africa: About $150 million NZD Why? </p>
            <p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle East: Roughly $100 million NZD. Our healthcare system could have benefited nicely with that.</p>
            <p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;South Asia: Approximately $80 million NZD.&nbsp;Nepal and Bangladesh, seriously?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;2024&nbsp;</p>
            <p>1)&nbsp; Pacific Island Countries: ~$550 million NZD&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Time to wake up our idiot politicians. Times are hard in NZ, when a lot of Kiwis are struggling to get by and the government does jackshit to help them yet we send millions to countries far away that have no impact on our lives here. Sort out your priorities dumbass government and put the citizens in NZ first above all others.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>At the least, let the citizens of New Zealand decide if or how much money we send overseas through referendum.</p>

        content: <div>
            <p>New Zealand is not a candy store for the world's people to come to. We need to implement stricter immigration policy that allows for people with the right skills and only allow for true assylum seekers to enter in limited numbers. It is not acceptable to let economic refugees come here at taxpayer expense.</p>
            <p>1) Immediately stop all Islamic immigration. Their values do not align with ours and they are not compatible with our society. Take a look at the damage they have done in the UK and how they are devestating Europe.We do not want to become the basket case that Europe has become. They cannot intergrate with non-Muslim societies, let them stay in their own shithole countries so we don't become messed up like the Islamic states. </p>
            <p>2) Immediately stop all family sponsorships. Immediate family only may immigrate.One immigrant cannot ship half their village here, that's just taking the piss out of our system.</p>
            <p>3) Implement a skills based points system to determine who can come here based on the needs of the economy weighed against the needs of the labourforce.</p>
            <p>4)&nbsp; True assylum seekers only can apply, those facing a real threat on their lives such as Chinese disedents, white South African farmers and Christians living in the Middle East. Groups such as these face real threats to their lives from government forces in their homelands.</p>
            <p>5) With the exception of a limited number of assylum-seeking refugees, no government financial support is to be given to any immigrants until they have lived in the country for 10 years, upon which time they will qualify for the same support offered to NZ citizens. Any immigrant who lacks the funds for financial independence will face deportation back to their country of origin.</p>
            <p>6) Any immigrant who commits a crime that receives imprisonment within their first 10 years here shall be deported back to their country of origin. It's just cheaper than keeping them in jail here and makes reoffending impossible.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>7) All imigrants must be able to speak English to a reasonably good level before entering. This is just common sense but judging by some of the staff at places like Farmers, some of their staff can hardly string a bloody sentence together. Therefore an IELTS English  level of at least 6.5 must be one of the requirements to come to New Zealand.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
